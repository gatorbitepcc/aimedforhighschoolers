            <p>	The world of AI, or artificial intelligence has existed for dozens of years, and definitely won’t stop anytime soon. Though in recent years, its progression seems to be accelerated by a massive amount. With new discoveries waiting at every corner, this gives many young and ambitious students a plethora of new opportunities. Though this rapid growth might also start to affect the more elderly. With AI starting to be able to replace people's positions in work, the many fields and jobs may start to redefine, with some positions not being needed anymore, but just as much more positions being created. With this knowledge, wouldn’t you want to go into this path and start to make new discoveries? Although before we go into that, we first should talk about what artificial intelligence actually is.
What is AI?
	Artificial intelligence is mankind’s attempt to simulate the human brain, or intelligence with the help of complex programs and machines. To be transparent, there are two main types of artificial intelligence, Traditional AI, and Generative AI. You probably have seen many examples of both, but just didn’t notice them. Traditional AI tends to make calculated and smart decisions with the information it has. The problem is, these types of AI’s are able to respond and spread information to others or strategically beat you in a game of chess, but they aren’t able to come up with things themselves. An example of this is, if you were to play a Traditional AI in a game of chess, it would only be able to make decisions based on the people it has played previously, or the way it was programmed. Sure these would be extremely smart and strategic moves, but none of this would come up with itself. On the other hand, Generative AI has the profound ability to be able to train itself, and the ability to come up with things itself. This means that it would be able to come up with its own stories, which takes it a step closer to being as accurate as it can to the human brain. Because in the end, it’s not really human if it can’t even demonstrate creativity. With the recent discovery of Generative AI, it seems very self explanatory as to why the field of AI’s growth has started to accelerate these past couple of years. Though at this point, you may be extremely confused as to how all of this works.
How Does AI Work?
	The AI we have today is all because of the power of vast and expansive neural networks. According to the massive company Amazon, neural networks are, “a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain.” These neural networks are collections of millions(number varies on amount of information the AI has) of nodes all strung together by synapses, similar to how your nerve cells are connected by synapses in your brain. To explain the complicated process of how the neural network is able to store what the AI has learnt in a very simple manner, the AI is able to learn because of tiny “weights” that reside between the connection of each node in a network.. Think of these weights as dials that control the importance of certain factors of what the AI is learning about. For example, if you were to show an AI who has never seen a watermelon before a picture of a watermelon, it will begin to take in a lot of information about it, like its size, its color, its shape, etc. All these factors important when determining whether an object is a watermelon or not will be determined by each factor's importance(what the weight controls). At the start of this learning process when these weights are randomized, if you were to show the AI a picture of a cantaloupe  and asked if it was a watermelon, it could say yes because it may believe size and shape prioritize over color when deciding if it was a watermelon or not. After either failing or succeeding the AI will change their weights in an attempt to more accurately give guesses. Upon thousands of more attempts, the AI would have eventually been able to have its weights exactly numbered into the factors importance, and would be able to accurately know all the features of the watermelon, and what makes something a watermelon and what doesn't. This is a very simple explanation and may not make sense on higher scales of the AI’s learning, but it gives you a general idea of how these programs are able to learn new information quickly. Know that there millions upon millions of these nodes and weights, and Chat GPT-3’s neural network contains 175 billion nodes alone! With the explanation of what AI truly is out of the way, it is time to talk about why it is so important for your life and future.
Why is AI So Important?
	With these rapid advancements in this field, many people across the world are starting to believe that they will start taking jobs, because of their pure efficiency and speed of being able to complete tasks and think within milliseconds. The problem with this is, these job paths that many children may dream about may be completely overtaken by machines soon enough. So you may be thinking, what is the fix to this? Simply put, start being more conversed with the topic of AI and possibly even take it as half your career path! For example, you can be a doctor, but still be very well versed in artificial intelligence and how to use it. This ensures your future self to have a much more impactful role and your workspace and majorly lower your rates of your job being stolen in the near future.
What Action Can I Take Now?
	If you would like to take action, and perhaps pursue this field in the near future, there are many things for you to do. Although, a simple thing I would suggest, is to try to stay updated, and look through our website. It will be filled with blogs similar to this one, and will even include things related to the field of medicine and how its related to AI(the next blog). Our website is also filled with courses that will be able to teach you how to code and potentially create your own ai. You don’t need to do any of these courses, but just keeping up with the latest blogs that are released, will generously improve your knowledge and could prove to be very helpful in the future.
